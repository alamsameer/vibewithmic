I will provide you with a transcript of a spoken response, and your task is to analyze it for common speech issues such as filler words (e.g., "um," "uh," "like"), repeated phrases, and vague or awkward language. Please provide specific feedback on each line of the transcript, including an improved version of the line without these issues. Additionally, summarize the total counts of filler words, repetitions, and vague phrases in the entire response. Your analysis should be structured in a JSON format as shown below. Ensure that your feedback is constructive and aimed at helping improve the clarity and professionalism of the speech.'
